# Load Balancing with Nginx

## What is a Load Balancer?

A load balancer is a device or software application that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. The primary purpose is to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed with too much traffic, improving the overall performance, availability, and reliability of the system.

## Using Nginx as a Load Balancer

Nginx is a versatile web server that can also act as a powerful load balancer. Below are examples of different types of load balancing configurations using Nginx.

### Round Robin Load Balancing

In this configuration, Nginx distributes incoming requests equally among the backend servers.

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server server1.example.com;
        server server2.example.com;
        server server3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

### Least Connections Load Balancing

With Least Connections, Nginx directs new requests to the backend server with the fewest active connections.
This helps balance the load based on the server's current capacity.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    least_conn;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    # Add more backend servers as needed
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
}

### IP Hash Load Balancing

IP Hash ensures that requests from the same IP address are always directed to the same backend server. This is useful for maintaining session persistence.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    ip_hash;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    # Add more backend servers as needed
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
}

### Least Time Load Balancing

The Least Time method directs requests to the backend server with the least average response time, helping optimize performance.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    least_time header;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    # Add more backend servers as needed
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
}
