# Nginx

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a powerful, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It is known for its high performance, low resource usage, and scalability. Originally developed to address the C10k problem (handling 10,000+ simultaneous connections), Nginx has become a popular choice for serving web content and handling various other tasks.

## Key Features

- **Web Server:**
  Nginx is often used as a web server to serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) and dynamic content through integration with application servers (like Passenger, uWSGI, or FastCGI). It is known for its speed and efficiency in serving static files.

- **Reverse Proxy:**
  Nginx is commonly used as a reverse proxy server, sitting in front of application servers to handle incoming requests. It can distribute requests to multiple application servers, improving performance and providing load balancing. This setup is particularly useful for handling large amounts of traffic and improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.

- **Load Balancer:**
  Nginx can act as a load balancer, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and improved fault tolerance. This helps distribute the load evenly among servers and prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

## Common Use Cases

- **Web Servers:**
  - Improve performance, scalability, and security of web applications.

- **Reverse Proxy:**
  - Enhance application performance by distributing requests to backend servers.
  - Achieve load balancing for improved scalability.

- **Load Balancer:**
  - Ensure optimal resource utilization.
  - Improve fault tolerance by distributing incoming traffic.

## Benefits of Using Nginx

- **High Performance:**
  - Known for its exceptional speed and efficiency in serving web content.

- **Scalability:**
  - Scales easily to handle increasing amounts of traffic and connections.

- **Low Resource Usage:**
  - Efficiently utilizes system resources, making it suitable for various environments.
