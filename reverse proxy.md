# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers and acts as an intermediary for client requests. It intercepts incoming requests, forwards them to the appropriate backend server, and then returns the responses to the clients. The reverse proxy is often invisible to users, who only see the public-facing URL of the reverse proxy.

## Key Functions

- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to improve performance and availability.
- **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed content to reduce load on backend servers and speed up response times.
- **SSL/TLS Termination:** Handles SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading the task from backend servers and potentially improving security.
- **Security:** Adds a layer of protection for backend servers by hiding their IP addresses and filtering requests.
- **Content Filtering:** Can control access to content based on rules or policies.
- **URL Rewriting:** Modifies URLs to redirect requests, mask internal server structures, or enable features like A/B testing.
- **Compression:** Compresses responses to reduce bandwidth usage and improve loading times.

## Common Uses

- **Web Servers:** Used to improve performance, scalability, and security of web applications.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Distribute content from multiple servers around the world to reduce latency and improve user experience.
- **API Gateways:** Manage and protect access to backend APIs.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Protect against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance:** Can significantly speed up response times and handle more concurrent users.
- **Enhanced Security:** Provides an additional layer of protection against attacks.
- **Increased Scalability:** Allows you to easily add more backend servers to handle growing traffic.
- **Simplified Management:** Centralizes configuration and management of multiple backend servers.
